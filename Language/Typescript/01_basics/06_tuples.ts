//a tuple is a data structure that allows you to store an ordered collection of elements. Each element in a tuple can have a different data type. Tuples are similar to arrays, but their individual elements can have specified types.

// Declare a tuple with elements of different types
let person: [string, number, boolean] = ["John Doe", 25, true];

// Accessing elements by index
let name: string = person[0];
let age: number = person[1];
let isStudent: boolean = person[2];




export {};
