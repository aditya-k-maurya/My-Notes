// Partials is a feature in scss which allow us to keep code in multiple files and then import in the main file

/*

Advantages-
1. small codes in every file so easy to manage
2. variables and mixin can be in seperate files and can be manipulated easily

Steps 
1. Name of the file should start with underscore eg- "_header.scss"
2. import in the the other files eg- '@import "header" '
